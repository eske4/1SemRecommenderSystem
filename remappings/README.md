### Python Scripts

#### 1. **run.py**

The `run.py` script is responsible for remapping data into indexed numbers. This is useful for converting categorical or string-based data into numerical indices that can be more efficiently processed by machine learning models or data analysis tools. Additionally, this script provides functionality to preview how the remapped data appears.

#### 2. **preview.py**

The `preview.py` script allows you to view and explore the datasets being used in the project. It offers a quick and easy way to inspect the structure and contents of the dataset, making it helpful for verifying data integrity and understanding the data format before running more complex analyses or transformations.
